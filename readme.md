Just an other wallpaper creator
=============================== 

License: [Creative Commons: CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/")

This project is work in progress. I do use it since several month now and it works nice with my configuration. I'm new to bash scripting, so bear with me.

It's designed for:

* ubuntu 12.04, unity desktop
* screen size 1920 x 1080
* be sure, you have a "tmp" directory (the scripts don't create it at the moment)

Important
---------

These scripts depend on imagemagick [1]. So if you want to use them, make sure, you installed the dependencies.

Usage
-----

```
./wpc-noloop .. will run the wallpaper creation process once. 
```

```    
wpc.sh -h .. to get help about "calendar" creation 	
wpc-note.sh -h to get help about "sticky note" creation 	
wpc-pic.sh -h  .. to get help about "picture stack" creation 	
```

More information can be found at the [wpc-homepage](http://wpc.tiddlyspace.com/)

###TODO
* Support different screen resolutions.
* Make the code better.

have fun!
